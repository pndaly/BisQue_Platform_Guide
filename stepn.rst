Summary
-------

**Congratulations, you have installed your first Python-based dockerized analysis module in BisQue!**

In short, what we have done is:

1. Obtained the latest BisQue docker image;
2. Created local working directories;
3. Cloned the code repository;
4. Attached code and working directories to a running instance of the BisQue docker image;
5. Updated the operating system and dependencies within the running container;
6. Registered the module;
7. Loaded some data files;
8. Tested the module functionality;
9. Edited the code and re-tested as required. Note that if the Python code is modified, there is no need to re-register the module. New code will require a re-load, however.
10. Dockerized the module.
11. Deployed to CyVerse testing stack (https://bisque.cyverse.org:8888/)
12. Edited the code and re-tested and re-deployed as required.
13. Deployed to CyVerse production stack (https://bisque.cyverse.org/)

You can now advertize your module to collaborators and colleagues.
